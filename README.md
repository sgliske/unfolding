# Unfolding Algorithm and Examples

Matlab code for unfolding the affect of limited acceptance.
  
## Source ##
  
These file implement the methods and simulations from paper
"Estimation of circular statistics in the presence of measurement
bias" by A. Aslammani, W.C. Stacey and S.V. Gliske.  Please cite this
paper as well as this github repository.

## File descriptions ##
  
The following files contain the main code for unfolding:
- pwc.m
- unfolding.m

The remaining matlab files recreate the main results of the paper.

## Instructions ##
  
Execute the file "run_all_simulations" to recreate Figs. 3-6 from
Alsammani et al. (2022). Due the stochastic nature of the simulations,
the results may show minor variation each time the code is executed.
